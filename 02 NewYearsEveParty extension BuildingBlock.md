## The first part of the exercise 
* The first path is the same as ['New Year's Eve Party'](https://github.com/cdaniel/faciliator-pack/blob/main/BuildingBlock-NewYearsEveParty.md).
* The group is expected to build a map for a New Year's Eve Party by:
  * Choose a spokesperson in a group. This will be the person that does the talking.
  * Agree upon the type of a party
  * Analyse the target user group and figure out what value will those people get.
  * Identify user needs
  * Identify capabilities required to meet those needs
  * Assign evolution levels
  * Repeat the process until the group is satisfied

## The second part of the exercise
* Participants receive additional information and constraints. They are supposed to update the original map and decide what is worth investing in.
* Constraints involve:
  * Target Audience - 50 friends and family members, total 96 people. It may not be possible to invite all.
    * 20 singles
    * 30 married (with their spouses), out of which
      * 10 with 1 child
      * 5 with 2 children
  * Budget - EUR 3000 (you can adapt it to your local currency)
  * Time window - they have to prepare the party from Dec 1st to Dec 19th. Depending on your culture and calendar, you might need to adjust those dates. The purpose is to be ready well ahead of time.
  * Differentiating constraints:
    * One group has access to a rural house with capacity for 40 people
    * One group has access to a community place for 60 people
    * One group has access to a Garden House for 50 people
    * One group has additional EUR 1000
  * Optionality - they have to "sell" the part on December 20th, which means to articulate the value of a party in such a way their friends and family will come.
* Participants should also be aware of how much sth costs:
  * Food - EUR 600
  * Parking - EUR 300
